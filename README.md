# 🧠 AI-Powered Task Management App (Local-First)

This project is a local-first AI-powered task management web application built with FastAPI (Python) and React, designed to help users manage tasks more efficiently using natural language and intelligent suggestions — all without relying on paid services or cloud APIs.

The app runs entirely locally, using a lightweight database and a locally hosted language model to provide AI features such as natural-language task creation, priority suggestions, and daily task summaries.
